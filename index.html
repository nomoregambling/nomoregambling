<h1 align="center"><font face="Lato" color="#ff0000" size="6">We aware you from Gambling</font></h1>
<h2 align="center">What comes on your mind when you listen gambling?</h2>
<h2 align="center">Chances to winning big?</h2>
<h2 align="center">Money Money Money?</h2>
<h2 align="center">Win big?</h2><br/>
<h2 align="center">Now we understand gambling mathematically and scientifically</h2><br/>
<h3 align="center">1.  Suppose i toss a coin and you bet on head</h3>
<h3 align="center">We know that coin have only two sides(Head and Tail)</h3>
<h3 align="center">Chances of you winning or i losing  =  your favorable outcome / total outcome</h3>
<h3 align="center">Or</h3>
<h3 align="center">= You bet placed on (head or tail) / total possibility(head and tail)</h3>
<h3 align="center">= You bet placed on head / coins have two sides(head and tail)</h3>
<h3 align="center">=  1/2    =  0.5</h3>
<h3 align="center">in terms of %  =  50 %</h3>
<h3 align="center">Chances of you losing or i winning  =  your non favorable outcome / total outcome</h3>
<h3 align="center">= you bet on head(and tail is my) / coins have two sides (head and tail)</h3>
<h3 align="center">=  1/2    =  0.5</h3>
<h3 align="center">in terms of %  =  50 %</h3>
<h3 align="center">Means that your chances to win and loss are equal = 50%</h3><br/>
<h3 align="center">2.  Suppose i rolled a dice and you bet on a 3 number</h3>
<h3 align="center">Dice have only six faces(1,2,3,4,5,6)</h3>
<h3 align="center">Chances of you winning or  i losing  =  your favorable outcome / total outcome</h3>
<h3 align="center">Or</h3>
<h3 align="center">=  you bet placed on / total possibility</h3>
<h3 align="center">= you bet placed on 3 number /  total number on dice (1,2,3,4,5,6)</h3>
<h3 align="center">=  1/6  =  0.1666</h3>
<h3 align="center">in terms of %  =  16.66 %</h3>
<h3 align="center">Chances of you losing or i winning  =  your non favorable outcome / total outcome</h3>
<h3 align="center">= you choose only one number i.e. 3(1,2,4,5,6 are my number) /  total number on dice (1,2,3,4,5,6)</h3>
<h3 align="center">=  5/6  =  0.833</h3>
<h3 align="center">in terms of %  =  83.33 %</h3>
<h3 align="center">but in the case of dice your chances of winning are 16.66 % and your chances of losing are 83.33 %</h3><br/>
<h2 align="center">You see number of outcome(possibility) increases, the chance of winning also decreases</h2>
<h2 align="center">1. In case of coin, chances of winning are 50 %</h2>
<h2 align="center">2. In case of dice, chances of winning are 16.66 %</h2><br/>
<h3 align="center">Suppose if you choose two number 1,3 in dice</h3>
<h3 align="center">1. Chances of winning are 33 %</h3>
<h3 align="center">2. Chances of losing are 66 %</h3><br/>
<h2 align="center">Five points always remember</h2>
<h2 align="center">1. If you place bet on more numbers your winning chances increases but if you are won so you got less money because you bet on more numbers.</h2>
<h2 align="center">2. If the possibilities of winning will be less, the more money you will get</h2>
<h2 align="center">3. Your chances of winning both games(two times or more times you won) are very low. suppose if you won a first game, the chances of second game you won are very low</h2>
<h3 align="center">a. first game you won their are only 16.66 % chances</h3>
<h3 align="center">b. if you won a first game, the chances of second game you won their are only 2.77 % chances(you won both games) and it decreases.</h3>
<h2 align="center">4. You place bet on which number which gives you high money(you take risk) and place bet again and again untill you won.</h2>
<h2 align="center">5. Never cover or chase loss.</h2><br/>
